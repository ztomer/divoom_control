# Roadmap — divoom-control

Consolidated view of shipped rounds, current state, and future work.
Per-round plans are pruned to git history once shipped; this file is the
forward-looking one. Recover a round plan with

## Shipped

- **v0.28.3 — R69**: version parity made structural. Binary selection goes by
  VERSION rather than by location or mtime, `divoomd --version` answers without
  starting a daemon (it used to start one), both binaries refuse unknown
  arguments instead of ignoring them, and `tools/check_built_binaries.py` fails
  the build when a compiled artifact disagrees with the tree.
- **v0.28.2**: tooling and docs only; the app is byte-for-byte the behaviour of
  v0.28.1. `scripts/gui_pov.py` promoted out of a scratchpad, macOS Bluetooth
  TCC written down, 14 dead scripts and `docs/archive/` pruned.
- **v0.28.1**: the GUI killed the daemon. `now_playing`/`players` built a
  `reqwest::blocking::Client` inside an async context, and dropping its private
  tokio runtime aborted the process — so opening the app with music paused took
  down the background service. Found by launching the app, not by the 2961
  passing tests.
- **v0.28.0 — R68**: two gates that were wrong about their own subject; the
  socket "hold it open" rule made structural (`HeldSocket`, enforced by Rust's
  drop order rather than by three comments); camoufox raised to the latest build
  through a main-world bridge; sysmon made a daemon client so the preview and
  the device draw the same bytes.

_"Key files" are the paths as they stood in that round. Several no longer exist
(`divoom_lib/device.py`, `models.py`, `hotchannel.py`, `display/clock.py`,
`tools/calendar.py`, `notification.py` were refactored away, and the whole
Python layer is reference-only now — `divoomd` is the product). They are left as
written rather than retro-mapped: a historical record guessed at is worse than
one that is plainly of its time._

## Current debt & quality

- **500-LOC rule**: fully enforced, ALLOWLIST empty (R23).
- **Font**: APK bitmap font extracted (ASCII + CJK via `from_apk_asset()`), half-size variant with majority-rule downsampling.
- **Tests**: hardware tests gated/skip by default; 60 native-downscaler parity tests; alarms editor JS guard; 18 E2E mock-device.
- **C module**: `libdivoom` (LANCZOS downsampler) compiled via `build_libdivoom.sh`; normalize-then-quantize kernel matches PIL byte-for-byte (60/60 parity tests).

## Open workstreams

### Near-term (next round)

_Actual state as of 2026-08-30, after R67._

**The Python layer is OBSOLETE and kept for REFERENCE ONLY.** `divoomd` (Rust)
is the shipping implementation; `divoom_lib/` is the protocol ground truth the
port was derived from, not a live second path. This matters for how findings are
read: "X exists in both Python and Rust" is NOT automatically drift to unify —
the Rust one is the product and the Python one is documentation. Two things are
still true and not contradicted by it:

* where the **GUI executes** Python that duplicates a daemon job, that IS a real
  defect (the GUI must be a client, not a second implementation) — this is what
  R67/C2 fixed for now-playing and weather;
* Python remains canonical for **wire formats**. Every R67 packet bug was found
  by diffing the Rust payload against the Python builder it was ported from, and
  Python was right every time. Parity gates that compare the two
  (`tools/check_weather_parity.py`) keep the port honest against its reference.

**Feishin — RESOLVED 2026-08-29.** It never appeared in now-playing because its
own `mediaSession` setting is OFF, so it does not register as a macOS Now
Playing client at all. Settled by enumerating the client registry rather than
by asking the user to quit apps. The fix is one toggle in Feishin, not code
here; the daemon's `players` reply carries a hint naming the setting. Left off
by user decision, so `nowplaying/src/feishin.rs` (Subsonic) remains its weaker
source. Detail in the v0.27.0 CHANGELOG stanza.

**Open: nothing in this workstream.** Both items closed in R68.

### Earlier shipped workstreams — pruned to git history

The camoufox pin raised to latest (R68), the GUI e2e migration off Playwright
(R66), and the R60-R61 short-to-medium-term list were all complete and were
being carried here as narrative. CHANGELOG is the durable record of what
shipped; this file is for what has not. Recover any of them with
`git log -p -- docs/ROADMAP.md`.

### R69 — SHIPPED in v0.28.3 (2026-08-30)

Four phases, all done; the plan itself is pruned to git history per the
one-forward-looking-doc rule. What it produced and the traps it hit are in the
CHANGELOG's v0.28.3 stanza — including the two the plan did NOT anticipate: an
audit that stopped three of its own steps from being built, and a green e2e
suite describing a panel that was visibly open on screen.

Recover the plan and its step ledger with
`git log -p -- docs/ROADMAP.md` (search for "R69 plan").

### Cloud HTTP — 533/533 endpoints cataloged

Full catalog at `docs/cloud_api/` (all 16 batches complete). Key shipped features:

- **Clock-face store** — public `Channel/GetDialType`+`GetDialList` API found via
  `r12f/divoom` crate. Wired into GUI as "Cloud Clock Faces" browser in Clock panel.
  Tests: 4 Playwright e2e.
- **Playlist browse+push** — `Playlist/GetMyList`/`SendDevice` confirmed RC=0. Wired
  into GUI as "Playlists" sub-tab in Pixel Art panel. Tests: 3 Playwright e2e.
- **AidSleep browse+play** — `RC=3` was a missing server-side device registration.
  `BlueDevice/NewDevice` lazy-registers on first use. Wired into GUI as "Sleep Sounds"
  sub-tab in Schedule panel. Tests: 4 Playwright e2e.
- **Photo album management** — `Photo/GetAlbumList` (cloud browse) + `Photo/PlayAlbum`
  (LAN apply). Wired into GUI as "Photo Albums" sub-tab.
- **LAN-getter completeness** — 8 read-back counterparts of BLE Set commands.
- **Channel extras** — 5-LCD commands, Voice/SendText, Danmaku: backend-only, not GUI-wired
  (need hardware or render confirmation).
- **`Cloud/ToDevice`** — unimplemented (unconfirmed semantics, no live caller).
- **`search_weather_city`** — implemented but not GUI-wired (weather uses system location).

### WiFi/LAN command completeness — 45 total, all implemented

Counted from `HttpCommand.java`'s `DeviceAndServerCmd` (43) + `ForceDeviceHttp` (2).
All 4 clusters implemented:
1. **Photo album management** (DONE, live, GUI-wired).
2. **LAN-getter completeness** (DONE, 8 read-back counterparts).
3. **Channel extras + Voice/SendText** (DONE, backend only, NOT GUI-wired — needs hardware).
4. **Danmaku scrolling overlay** (DONE, backend only, NOT GUI-wired — unconfirmed render).

Bonus fix: device-selector "not in range" badge now counts consecutive scan misses
(downgrades after 2), not a one-shot startup flag. 5 new e2e tests.

### Deferred

- **Cloud browse cannot say WHY it is empty** (found 2026-08-30 exercising the
  real backend). `search_weather_city`, `get_dial_list`, `get_my_playlists`,
  `get_aid_sleep_list` and the photo-album browse all catch their exception and
  return `[]`, so every panel shows "nothing found" whether the result is
  genuinely empty, the cloud is unreachable, or the account is unauthenticated.
  A failed state must say why. Fix as a CLASS in the shared shape — five
  features and their tests — not one panel at a time.
- **`search_weather_city` success path unverified.** The pre-release check ran
  under a throwaway HOME, so it exercised the no-credentials branch
  (`UserNewGuest RC=10`) and proved only the error path. Needs one manual search
  on a configured account.

- **`pic_scan_ctrl` 0x35** — partially resolved (2026-07-13, real hardware).
  Accepted without error by BLE stack; no visual confirmation (no camera).
  See `divoom_lib/display/drawing.py` / `divoomd/src/device_call/drawing.rs`.
- **`Cloud/ToDevice`** — unimplemented, unconfirmed semantics.
- **R12 hardware verification** — user-driven (album cover, custom art, weather on real device).

## Native Rust daemon (`divoomd/`) — DONE

**Goal: ACHIEVED.** The Python daemon backend was deprecated in favor of
`divoomd` (Rust, built on `btleplug` + `tokio` + `serde`) at 100% socket +
hardware parity (2026-06-29). Python daemon server archived 2026-07-13 (13
server-side modules archived, then removed from the tree in R66, client-side infra stays
active in `divoom_client/` (renamed from `divoom_daemon/` in R66) —
`daemon_client.py`, `daemon_protocol.py`,
`macos_notifications.py`). Full device parity (54 → 0 gaps), cloud decode,
hardware-verified on Pixoo/Timoo/Ditoo/Tivoo Max. Menubar is a standalone Rust
agent (`divoom-menubar/`); the GUI stays the Python pywebview UI
(the native-egui-UI effort was explored and retired). `cargo test` is green on
both feature matrices (291 workspace tests at v0.28.3).

Key: `divoomd` is now the **sole shipping daemon** — no `DIVOOM_USE_RUST_DAEMON`
opt-out. The archived server and its 469 tests were removed from the tree in
R66 (2026-08-17); recover from git history if ever needed.

## Architecture summary

- **UI**: Python pywebview GUI (unchanged, 9k-LOC static `web_ui/` frontend).
- **Daemon**: Rust `divoomd` (unix-socket NDJSON, sole BLE/LAN owner).
- **Menubar**: Rust `divoom-menubar` (standalone agent, replaces pyobjc).
- **Encoders**: C `libdivoom` (LANCZOS downsampler, reused via FFI).
- **Transport**: BLE (CoreBluetooth via `btleplug`) + LAN (HTTP to device) + Cloud (HTTP to Divoom).

## Planning docs by round

All round plans (R3 onward) and superseded workstream plans are pruned to git
history; `docs/archive/` no longer exists at all. This ROADMAP is the one
forward-looking document, and CHANGELOG is the record of what shipped.

Recover a pruned plan with
`git log --diff-filter=D -- 'docs/**/PLANNING_*'`.
