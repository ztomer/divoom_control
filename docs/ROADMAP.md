## Current debt & quality

- **500-LOC rule**: fully enforced, ALLOWLIST empty (R23).
- **Font**: APK bitmap font extracted (ASCII + CJK via `from_apk_asset()`), half-size variant with majority-rule downsampling.
- **Tests**: hardware tests gated/skip by default; 60 native-downscaler parity tests; alarms editor JS guard; 18 E2E mock-device.
- **C module**: `libdivoom` (LANCZOS downsampler) compiled via `build_libdivoom.sh`; normalize-then-quantize kernel matches PIL byte-for-byte (60/60 parity tests).

## Open workstreams

### Near-term (next round)

Native-port hardening (Phases 1-4 + Phase-5 command parity) shipped; see
`docs/archive/superseded/PLANNING_NATIVE_PORT_HARDENING.md` for the historical
record. Phase 5 step 5.3 (the irreversible `divoom_daemon/` server archival)
shipped 2026-07-13 on explicit user sign-off — see the "Native Rust daemon"
section below for detail. No remaining thread here.

### Short-to-medium term (all shipped)

The following workstreams from earlier rounds are complete:

- **`show_clock()` overlay reorder (R60)** — realigned to APK C2() canonical format.
- **`get_*` read-back timeouts (R60)** — bounded + cached in both Python and Rust.
- **R12 visual pass (2026-07-14)** — Gemini design critique, 2 real CSS fixes applied.
- **Menubar connection-feedback (v0.22.10)** — hardware-verified on real Pixoo-1.
- **Daemon-down banner / reconnect (v0.22.10)** — hardware-verified, auto-heal confirmed.
- **Inline-style → CSS-token migration batches 3-5 (v0.22.11)** — all three files completed.
- **R12 hardware verification** — user-driven (album cover, custom art, weather on real device).

### Cloud HTTP — 533/533 endpoints cataloged

Full catalog at `docs/cloud_api/` (all 16 batches complete). Key shipped features:

- **Clock-face store** — public `Channel/GetDialType`+`GetDialList` API found via
  `r12f/divoom` crate. Wired into GUI as "Cloud Clock Faces" browser in Clock panel.
  Tests: 4 Playwright e2e.
- **Playlist browse+push** — `Playlist/GetMyList`/`SendDevice` confirmed RC=0. Wired
  into GUI as "Playlists" sub-tab in Pixel Art panel. Tests: 3 Playwright e2e.
- **AidSleep browse+play** — `RC=3` was a missing server-side device registration.
  `BlueDevice/NewDevice` lazy-registers on first use. Wired into GUI as "Sleep Sounds"
  sub-tab in Schedule panel. Tests: 4 Playwright e2e.
- **Photo album management** — `Photo/GetAlbumList` (cloud browse) + `Photo/PlayAlbum`
  (LAN apply). Wired into GUI as "Photo Albums" sub-tab.
- **LAN-getter completeness** — 8 read-back counterparts of BLE Set commands.
- **Channel extras** — 5-LCD commands, Voice/SendText, Danmaku: backend-only, not GUI-wired
  (need hardware or render confirmation).
- **`Cloud/ToDevice`** — unimplemented (unconfirmed semantics, no live caller).
- **`search_weather_city`** — implemented but not GUI-wired (weather uses system location).

### WiFi/LAN command completeness — 45 total, all implemented

Counted from `HttpCommand.java`'s `DeviceAndServerCmd` (43) + `ForceDeviceHttp` (2).
All 4 clusters implemented:
1. **Photo album management** (DONE, live, GUI-wired).
2. **LAN-getter completeness** (DONE, 8 read-back counterparts).
3. **Channel extras + Voice/SendText** (DONE, backend only, NOT GUI-wired — needs hardware).
4. **Danmaku scrolling overlay** (DONE, backend only, NOT GUI-wired — unconfirmed render).

Bonus fix: device-selector "not in range" badge now counts consecutive scan misses
(downgrades after 2), not a one-shot startup flag. 5 new e2e tests.

### Migrate the GUI e2e suite off Playwright/Chromium → camoufox

**Scope correction:** the Playwright dependency is **not** in `divoom_lib` (zero
hits there). It is the GUI e2e suite — **15 test files under `tests/`** that
drive `divoom_gui/web_ui/` via `p.chromium.launch(headless=True)`, plus the two
CI steps that install it (`.github/workflows/tests.yml:45,50`).

Move these to **camoufox** (anti-detect Firefox, driven through the same
Playwright API — so the migration is mostly the launch call plus the browser
install step, not a rewrite of the 15 suites).

Why now:
- **The skip guard does not guard.** CI claims these "skip via
  `pytest.importorskip`" when the browser is absent, but `importorskip` only
  checks the Python *module* — the browser *binary* being missing raises
  `BrowserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist`, so they **fail** instead of
  skipping. Measured 2026-08-17: a clean checkout with the `playwright` module
  installed but no chromium produced **69 failures/errors** that look like real
  regressions and are not. Fix the guard as part of this move (probe the
  browser, not the import) regardless of which engine wins.
- Chromium is a ~130 MB per-machine download that every fresh dev environment
  silently fails without.
- camoufox is already the house browser-automation transport (see the
  `gemini-camoufox` skill), so this consolidates on one engine.

Acceptance: all 15 suites green under camoufox; a missing browser **skips**
(proven by deleting the browser and watching them skip, not by assuming);
CI install step updated; no `p.chromium` references left in `tests/`.

### Deferred

- **`pic_scan_ctrl` 0x35** — partially resolved (2026-07-13, real hardware).
  Accepted without error by BLE stack; no visual confirmation (no camera).
  See `divoom_lib/display/drawing.py` / `divoomd/src/device_call/drawing.rs`.
- **`Cloud/ToDevice`** — unimplemented, unconfirmed semantics.
- **R12 hardware verification** — user-driven (album cover, custom art, weather on real device).

## Native Rust daemon (`divoomd/`) — DONE

**Goal: ACHIEVED.** The Python daemon backend was deprecated in favor of
`divoomd` (Rust, built on `btleplug` + `tokio` + `serde`) at 100% socket +
hardware parity (2026-06-29). Python daemon server archived 2026-07-13 (13
server-side modules archived, then removed from the tree in R66, client-side infra stays
active in `divoom_daemon/` — `daemon_client.py`, `daemon_protocol.py`,
`macos_notifications.py`). Full device parity (54 → 0 gaps), cloud decode,
hardware-verified on Pixoo/Timoo/Ditoo/Tivoo Max. Menubar is a standalone Rust
agent (`divoom-menubar/`); the GUI stays the Python pywebview UI
(the native-egui-UI effort was explored and retired). `cargo test` 63/63 both
feature matrices.

Key: `divoomd` is now the **sole shipping daemon** — no `DIVOOM_USE_RUST_DAEMON`
opt-out. The archived server and its 469 tests were removed from the tree in
R66 (2026-08-17); recover from git history if ever needed.

## Architecture summary

- **UI**: Python pywebview GUI (unchanged, 9k-LOC static `web_ui/` frontend).
- **Daemon**: Rust `divoomd` (unix-socket NDJSON, sole BLE/LAN owner).
- **Menubar**: Rust `divoom-menubar` (standalone agent, replaces pyobjc).
- **Encoders**: C `libdivoom` (LANCZOS downsampler, reused via FFI).
- **Transport**: BLE (CoreBluetooth via `btleplug`) + LAN (HTTP to device) + Cloud (HTTP to Divoom).
