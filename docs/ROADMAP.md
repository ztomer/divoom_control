## Current debt & quality

- **500-LOC rule**: fully enforced, ALLOWLIST empty (R23).
- **Font**: APK bitmap font extracted (ASCII + CJK via `from_apk_asset()`), half-size variant with majority-rule downsampling.
- **Tests**: hardware tests gated/skip by default; 60 native-downscaler parity tests; alarms editor JS guard; 18 E2E mock-device.
- **C module**: `libdivoom` (LANCZOS downsampler) compiled via `build_libdivoom.sh`; normalize-then-quantize kernel matches PIL byte-for-byte (60/60 parity tests).

## Open workstreams

### Near-term (next round)

_Actual state as of 2026-08-30, after R67._

**The Python layer is OBSOLETE and kept for REFERENCE ONLY.** `divoomd` (Rust)
is the shipping implementation; `divoom_lib/` is the protocol ground truth the
port was derived from, not a live second path. This matters for how findings are
read: "X exists in both Python and Rust" is NOT automatically drift to unify —
the Rust one is the product and the Python one is documentation. Two things are
still true and not contradicted by it:

* where the **GUI executes** Python that duplicates a daemon job, that IS a real
  defect (the GUI must be a client, not a second implementation) — this is what
  R67/C2 fixed for now-playing and weather;
* Python remains canonical for **wire formats**. Every R67 packet bug was found
  by diffing the Rust payload against the Python builder it was ported from, and
  Python was right every time. Parity gates that compare the two
  (`tools/check_weather_parity.py`) keep the port honest against its reference.

**Feishin — RESOLVED 2026-08-29.** It never appeared in now-playing because its
own `mediaSession` setting is OFF, so it does not register as a macOS Now
Playing client at all. Settled by enumerating the client registry rather than
by asking the user to quit apps. The fix is one toggle in Feishin, not code
here; the daemon's `players` reply carries a hint naming the setting. Left off
by user decision, so `nowplaying/src/feishin.rs` (Subsonic) remains its weaker
source. Detail in `docs/PLANNING_ROUND67.md`.

**Open:**

- **Ambient preview tiles are static CSS** (`divoom_gui/web_ui/channels_grids.js`)
  — flat colour blocks that do not reflect device state. This is the
  dishonest-preview half of R67/C2, and the reason the ambient bug presented as
  "green/magenta" rather than "the mode never reached the device". Fixing it is
  what makes that class of bug visible next time.
- **sysmon preview** is rendered by `divoom_lib/utils/media_source.py` (psutil)
  while the device frame comes from `divoomd/src/live_jobs/render.rs`. Under the
  reference-only rule this is NOT a unification task — but the GUI does still
  *execute* the Python renderer, which is the shape C2 covers. Low value: simple
  numbers, no artwork to disagree about.

### Short-to-medium term (all shipped)

### Short-to-medium term (all shipped)

The following workstreams from earlier rounds are complete:

- **`show_clock()` overlay reorder (R60)** — realigned to APK C2() canonical format.
- **`get_*` read-back timeouts (R60)** — bounded + cached in both Python and Rust.
- **R12 visual pass (2026-07-14)** — Gemini design critique, 2 real CSS fixes applied.
- **Menubar connection-feedback (v0.22.10)** — hardware-verified on real Pixoo-1.
- **Daemon-down banner / reconnect (v0.22.10)** — hardware-verified, auto-heal confirmed.
- **Inline-style → CSS-token migration batches 3-5 (v0.22.11)** — all three files completed.
- **R12 hardware verification** — user-driven (album cover, custom art, weather on real device).

### Cloud HTTP — 533/533 endpoints cataloged

Full catalog at `docs/cloud_api/` (all 16 batches complete). Key shipped features:

- **Clock-face store** — public `Channel/GetDialType`+`GetDialList` API found via
  `r12f/divoom` crate. Wired into GUI as "Cloud Clock Faces" browser in Clock panel.
  Tests: 4 Playwright e2e.
- **Playlist browse+push** — `Playlist/GetMyList`/`SendDevice` confirmed RC=0. Wired
  into GUI as "Playlists" sub-tab in Pixel Art panel. Tests: 3 Playwright e2e.
- **AidSleep browse+play** — `RC=3` was a missing server-side device registration.
  `BlueDevice/NewDevice` lazy-registers on first use. Wired into GUI as "Sleep Sounds"
  sub-tab in Schedule panel. Tests: 4 Playwright e2e.
- **Photo album management** — `Photo/GetAlbumList` (cloud browse) + `Photo/PlayAlbum`
  (LAN apply). Wired into GUI as "Photo Albums" sub-tab.
- **LAN-getter completeness** — 8 read-back counterparts of BLE Set commands.
- **Channel extras** — 5-LCD commands, Voice/SendText, Danmaku: backend-only, not GUI-wired
  (need hardware or render confirmation).
- **`Cloud/ToDevice`** — unimplemented (unconfirmed semantics, no live caller).
- **`search_weather_city`** — implemented but not GUI-wired (weather uses system location).

### WiFi/LAN command completeness — 45 total, all implemented

Counted from `HttpCommand.java`'s `DeviceAndServerCmd` (43) + `ForceDeviceHttp` (2).
All 4 clusters implemented:
1. **Photo album management** (DONE, live, GUI-wired).
2. **LAN-getter completeness** (DONE, 8 read-back counterparts).
3. **Channel extras + Voice/SendText** (DONE, backend only, NOT GUI-wired — needs hardware).
4. **Danmaku scrolling overlay** (DONE, backend only, NOT GUI-wired — unconfirmed render).

Bonus fix: device-selector "not in range" badge now counts consecutive scan misses
(downgrades after 2), not a one-shot startup flag. 5 new e2e tests.

### GUI e2e suite migrated to camoufox — SHIPPED (R66, v0.23.0)

All 15 modules moved off Playwright/Chromium behind one seam
(`tests/support/browser.py`); no `p.chromium` references remain in `tests/`.
CI installs camoufox instead of chromium.

The guard defect that motivated this is fixed and pinned by
`tests/test_e2e_browser_guard.py`: `pytest.importorskip` only proved the Python
*module* imported, so a missing browser **binary** produced 69 failures that
read as real regressions. `require_browser()` now probes the binary.

Acceptance met, with one honest note on how: the criterion said "proven by
deleting the browser". It is instead proven by driving camoufox's own
not-installed path (`get_active_path() -> None`, which makes `installed_verstr()`
raise `CamoufoxNotInstalled`) rather than deleting a ~150 MB install per run.
That is stronger than the first attempt, which stubbed `installed_verstr` to
return `""` — a value the library never actually produces, so it proved our
branch worked without proving reality reaches it. The suite also asserts the
guard does NOT over-skip, since a guard that always skipped would silently
disable all 15 suites while looking green.

Two latent test races surfaced during the move (both waited on a proxy DOM
signal and asserted on a different one — a Chromium timing coincidence) and were
fixed as a class.

### Deferred

- **`pic_scan_ctrl` 0x35** — partially resolved (2026-07-13, real hardware).
  Accepted without error by BLE stack; no visual confirmation (no camera).
  See `divoom_lib/display/drawing.py` / `divoomd/src/device_call/drawing.rs`.
- **`Cloud/ToDevice`** — unimplemented, unconfirmed semantics.
- **R12 hardware verification** — user-driven (album cover, custom art, weather on real device).

## Native Rust daemon (`divoomd/`) — DONE

**Goal: ACHIEVED.** The Python daemon backend was deprecated in favor of
`divoomd` (Rust, built on `btleplug` + `tokio` + `serde`) at 100% socket +
hardware parity (2026-06-29). Python daemon server archived 2026-07-13 (13
server-side modules archived, then removed from the tree in R66, client-side infra stays
active in `divoom_client/` (renamed from `divoom_daemon/` in R66) —
`daemon_client.py`, `daemon_protocol.py`,
`macos_notifications.py`). Full device parity (54 → 0 gaps), cloud decode,
hardware-verified on Pixoo/Timoo/Ditoo/Tivoo Max. Menubar is a standalone Rust
agent (`divoom-menubar/`); the GUI stays the Python pywebview UI
(the native-egui-UI effort was explored and retired). `cargo test` 63/63 both
feature matrices.

Key: `divoomd` is now the **sole shipping daemon** — no `DIVOOM_USE_RUST_DAEMON`
opt-out. The archived server and its 469 tests were removed from the tree in
R66 (2026-08-17); recover from git history if ever needed.

## Architecture summary

- **UI**: Python pywebview GUI (unchanged, 9k-LOC static `web_ui/` frontend).
- **Daemon**: Rust `divoomd` (unix-socket NDJSON, sole BLE/LAN owner).
- **Menubar**: Rust `divoom-menubar` (standalone agent, replaces pyobjc).
- **Encoders**: C `libdivoom` (LANCZOS downsampler, reused via FFI).
- **Transport**: BLE (CoreBluetooth via `btleplug`) + LAN (HTTP to device) + Cloud (HTTP to Divoom).

## Planning docs by round

Historical round plans (R3–R61) and superseded workstream plans were pruned to
git history — `docs/archive/rounds/` and `docs/archive/superseded/` no longer
exist. Recover any of them with `git log --diff-filter=D -- 'docs/**/PLANNING_*'`.
`PLANNING_ROUND62.md` and later shipped rounds also archived there.
